        Upon furthur use of Rpg Maker MV, we found that it ws not suiting our needs and giving us the amount of 
        flexibility that we desired to make our first test game. We have looked at a few other game engines and decided
        to move our efforts to GameMaker Studio 2. This is a game development framework that is heavily reliant on object
        oriented coding. It also uses a slightly altered version of C++ which is easiest for our programmer to use. With
        this being said, we have already started working on our first game which will be a platformer. The name and art 
        are soon to be posted but we have the basics down as in a character, simple movement, a weapon, and enemies.

        Let us begin. We've decided to begin our integration into the game development scene by using the framework of
        RPG Maker MV. We've chosen this due to our limited experience with game design but we will still put our hearts
        into it. RPG Maker MV, unlike its previous versions, uses the coding language of JavaScript and has the character
        style reminiscent of older eight bit style games such as those made on the NES. One of the pitfalls of using this
        engine is that it is very easy to make a generic rpg maker game. We hope that through the art skill of our devs
        and repeated revision and reworking of our story, our project will be notable. Most importantly, we hope to gain
        experience in game development through this project. Further updates will be coming soon. -11/13/2017
