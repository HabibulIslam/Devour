      <p class="hometext-paragraph">
        Instead of crawling down the beaten path for what has been presented as promised 
        "financial security" in the form of college education, a realization occurs that formal education is not all that it 
        has been cracked up to be. To live a life where work is to simply provide the necessities of living is not 
        a life worth living and should not be wished upon any other life. A formal education steers
        in this very direction of investment into the future as if it knew what the answer to the question every contestant of
        generation z asks. Where are "we" going? Whether the future holds destruction or prosperity, what is true is that the 
        present will no longer be. The actions we take today will determine the fate of the cruel world humans have caused and 
        newer generations have come to inherit.

      <p class="hometext-paragraph">
        I ask myself where three contemporary millennials, Habibul, Shahbab, and Ibrahim, fit into all of this. The sum total of 
        human existance has manifested itself into the surroundings and circumstances that dominate daily life and
        I, Habibul, am truly disgusted by it. The idea that for power to exist, there must be those with a lack of it is 
        logical, yet false and should be understood. There can be a rich without the poor, the confident without the aimless, and the 
        content without the depressed. If formal education will lead me to a "good", "happy", and "secure" life of work then 
        what I want is a life of struggle, unhappiness, and insecurity akin to what every human faces in life at some point if 
        at the end of the day, I can say what I have done means something. This way of seeing manifested itself into what, on 
        October 20, 2017, was published as a means to an end.

      <p class="hometext-paragraph">
        We, Habibul, Shahbab, and Ibrahim, titled the publication of our game development website Devour. Devour is hope that 
        one day when the cavernous abyss that is the cycle of unmeaningful task for compensation knocks 
        on our door, we do not have to answer. Devour means that when the opportunity arises for us to make a
        difference in the current state of the world, you better be damn sure that we will be the ones a the helm. And Devour 
        ensures that when the day comes where we can do what we love as a lifestyle, we will use every ounce of 
        our being to inspire those without a voice, without privilege, without power, and without hope to find the greatness 
        that has been within them all along.
